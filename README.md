# hello-world
This is the repository I made for Hello World tutorial from the documentation

It is nice to know that as a tradition we insist the computer tell us "Hello". I think it comes from the same place in our
hearts that leads us to name giant robots that explore other planets "Curiousity". We want the best parts
of us to be reflected in the work we do. And humans are social beings.
